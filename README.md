Aurélien Liné is a yound researcher, currently completing his PhD in Climate Sciences.
He is interested in the role of internal variability of climate, through physical processes, in the modulation of the climate change at near-term arround a forced response, caused by anthropogenic forcings (GHG, aerosols, land use, ..).
