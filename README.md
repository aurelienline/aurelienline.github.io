Aurélien Liné is a yound researcher, currently completing his PhD in Climate Sciences in Toulouse.

He is interested in the role of internal variability of climate, through physical processes, in the modulation of climate changes at near-term.
His work is supervised by [Christophe Cassou](https://cerfacs.fr/~cassou/) and [Rym Msadek](https://cerfacs.fr/~msadek/), conducted at [Cerfacs](https://cerfacs.fr/en/climate-modelling-and-global-change-globc/) in relation with EDF, and is affiliated to the [University of Toulouse](https://en.univ-toulouse.fr/).
